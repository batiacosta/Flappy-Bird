This is like the flappy bird you know. To play, you need to tap (if mobile), press Space, or left mouse button to make the bird flap avoiding the impact against the pipes. The difficulty increases as long as you avoid more pipes, so the gap gets reduced and the pipes get a bit closer.


We get a very straight forward main menu

The bird floats until you tap once to start the level

The game counts how many pipes you achieve to avoid. It saves the highest score
